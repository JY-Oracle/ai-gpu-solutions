# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This workshop gets you through examples from Nvidia for using machine learning for default risk which is a very common debt use case in the capital markets, banking, and insurance. These examples will be deployed in OCI and applied on a Fannie Mae's large public dataset. In the examples we will apply XGBoost and Pytorch classifiers to process the data and visualize using Shapley values clusters.

Estimated Workshop Time: 2 hours

### Objectives

Objective of this workshop is to go through examples from Nvidia for using machine learning for default risk

In this workshop, you will learn how to:

* Run machine learning algorithms for default risk

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* An Oracle Cloud account
* Administrator permissions or permissions to use the OCI Compute and Identity Domains
* Access to A100 or GPU shape, Usage of the Terraform code for one click deployment.

## Learn More

* [What Is XGBoost?](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/)
* [Credit Default Risk](https://github.com/NVIDIA/fsi-samples/tree/main/credit_default_risk)

You may now proceed to the next lab.

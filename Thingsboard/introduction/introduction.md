# Introduction

## About this Workshop

OCI currently lacks an IoT solution, so we're exploring a third-party option called ThingsBoard. This platform gathers data from various devices and supports diverse industries, including healthcare. The data passes through ThingsBoard, where it may undergo transformation, preparing it for ingestion into OCI. Integration occurs via OCI Streaming, enabling further utilization across different services. To deploy ThingsBoard, you can obtain a VM through the Marketplace image and access its interface using a public IP address.
